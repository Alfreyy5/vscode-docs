## Chat

### Math support in chat (Preview)

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Azure Dev Ops repos fast `#codebase` support

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Improved reliability and performance of the run in terminal and task tools

The tools for running tasks and commands within the terminal have been migrated from the Copilot extension into the core [microsoft/vscode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). This gives the tools access to lower level and richer APIs allowing us to fix many of the terminal hanging issues. This also comes with the benefit of more easily implementing features going forward as we're no longer restricted to what's in the extension API, especially any changes that need custom UI within the chat view.

### Terminal auto-approve improvements (Experimental)

Early terminal auto approve settings were introduced last month. This release the feature got many improvements:

- The `allowList` and `denyList` settings have been merged and live under `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove`. If you were on the old setting you should see a warning to migrate to the new one.
- Regular expression matchers now support flags, this allows case insensitivity for example in powershell where case often doesn't matter:
    ```json
    "chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove": {
      // Deny any `remote-item` command, regardless of case
      "/^Remove-Item\\b/i": false
    }
    ```
- There was some confusion around how the sub-command matching works, this is now explained in detail in the setting's description, but we also support matching against the complete command line.
    ```jsonc
    "chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove": {
      // Deny any _command line_ containing a reference to what is likely a powershell script
      "/\\.ps1\\b/i": { approve: false, matchCommandLine: true }
    }
    ```
- The auto approve reasoning is now logged to the Terminal output channel. We plan to [surface this in the UI soon](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/256780).

### Warning about no shell integration when using chat

When the run in terminal tool is used but [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) is not detected, a message is displayed calling this out and pointing at the documentation:

![A message saying "Enable shell integration to improve command detection" will appear](images/1_103/terminal-chat-si-none.png)

While we do strive to allow agent mode to run commands in terminals without shell integration, the experience will always be inferior as the terminal is essentially a black box at that point. Examples of issues that can occur without shell integration are no exit code reporting and the inability to differentiate between a command idling and a prompt idling, resulting in output possibly not being reported to the agent.

### Output polling for tasks and terminals

The agent now waits for tasks and background terminals to complete before proceeding, using output polling. If a process takes longer than 20 seconds, you are prompted to continue waiting or move on. The agent will monitor the process for up to 2 minutes, summarizing the current state or reporting if the process is still running. This improves reliability when running long or error-prone commands in chat.

### Task awareness improvement

Previously, the agent could only monitor active tasks. Now, it can track and analyze the output of both active and completed tasks, including those that have failed or finished running. This enhancement enables better troubleshooting and more comprehensive insights into task execution history.

### Agent awareness of user created terminals

The agent now maintains awareness of all user-created terminals in the workspace. This allows it to track recent commands and access terminal output, providing better context for assisting with terminals and troubleshooting.

## Accessibility

### Accessible chat elicitations

When the agent prompts for user input (such as whether to keep waiting for a process), the chat elicitation is now accessible to screen readers. Users are alerted when the prompt appears, can navigate to it with the keyboard, and can review the message in the accessible view.

### Control file opening for chat edits

A new setting, `accessibility.openChatEditedFiles`, lets you choose whether files are automatically opened as the agent edits them in chat. Enable this setting for more control over which files appear in your editor.

### View all and previous edits commands

The **View All Edits** and **View Previous Edits** commands are now available throughout the editor, making it easy to review changes made by the agent. These commands are especially helpful when `accessibility.openChatEditedFiles` is disabled, allowing you to track edits without opening each file.

### Sidebar visibility announcements

When the primary or secondary sidebar is shown or hidden, an ARIA announcement now notifies users of the change. This improves accessibility by ensuring screen reader users are aware of sidebar visibility updates.

### Accessibility testing with Playwright

We have added automated accessibility tests for the editor using Playwright. These tests help us continuously validate that Visual Studio Code meets accessibility standards and best practices, ensuring a better experience for all users.

## Editor Experience

### Settings search suggestions

The AI search results toggle in the search box of the Settings editor, indicated by a sparkle, is now available for all users.

The toggle is enabled when AI search results have loaded in and are available, and pressing the toggle switches between the AI and non-AI search results. The AI settings search results are based on semantic similarity instead of string matching. For example, `editor.fontSize` appears as an AI settings search result when you search for "increase text size".

## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control
**Setting**: `setting(git.detectWorktrees)`

To address a long-standing [feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68038), this milestone we have added Git worktree support. Worktrees let you check out multiple branches at once, making it easy to test changes or work in parallel without switching contexts. You can now view, create, delete, and open worktrees in a new or current window using commands available from the Command Palette or Source Control view.

## Debugging


## Tasks

## Terminal

### Suggest (Experimental)

We've further enhanced the opt-in terminal suggestion experience (`terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled`). In this release, the time to show the first suggestion after reloading the window has been significantly reduced, and subsequent suggestions now appear with lower latency. These improvements make terminal completions faster and more responsive.

### Voice Dictation
Now that natural language input is supported in terminals—including those enabled by the Gemini and Claude extensions—voice dictation has been reintroduced in the terminal. You can start or stop dictation using the **Terminal: Start Dictation in Terminal** and **Terminal: Stop Dictation in Terminal** commands.

### Improved shell integration diagnostics

[Shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) is the foundation that many features in the integrated terminal are built upon such as [sticky scroll](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_sticky-scroll), [quick fixes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_quick-fixes) and [agent mode's](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) ability to understand what's happening inside the terminal.

This release features some improved diagnostics when you hover the terminal and select "Show Details". You should now see the detected shell type and current working directory:

![The detailed terminal tab hover shows the shell type like pwsh and the current working directory](images/1_103/terminal-si-diagnostics.png)

This is one of the first places to look if one of these rich features isn't working as expected.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_103.md).

## Languages

### TypeScript 5.9

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Expandable hovers for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Contributions to extensions


## Extension Authoring


## Proposed APIs

### Custom webview based widgets in chat responses

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/chat-output-renderer-sample

### Terminal activation events
Two new activation events are available for extensions:

- `onTerminal`: Triggered when any terminal is opened.
- `onTerminalShellIntegration`: Triggered when rich shell integration is activated for a terminal.

You can specify a `shellType` to target specific shells. For example, `onTerminalShellIntegration:bash` activates when shell integration is enabled for a Bash terminal.

### Task execution terminal

Extension authors can now access the terminal associated with a running task via the new `taskExecution.terminal` property. This makes it easier to identify which terminal is linked to a specific task and interact with it programmatically.

## Engineering

### packages.microsoft.com key update

packages.microsoft.com has updated their signing key. As a result, Linux users on newer distributions should stop seeing key-related warnings or errors while installing VS Code. Debian-based distributions will receive the new key automatically, whereas users on other distributions may have to manually remove the old key before [importing the new key](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_install-vs-code-on-linux).
